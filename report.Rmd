#### preprocessing

##### Column name legalization 
remove "Id" column, and "X" to column names which start with digital.

##### Handle Missing Value

These columns have missing value rate > 10%:
PoolQC, MiscFeature, Alley, Fence, FireplaceQu, LotFrontage, Neighborhood

column PoolQC, Alley, Fence have special meaning, so we fill with string("NA")
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, cache = TRUE)
